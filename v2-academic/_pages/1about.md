Hi! I'm a student at Harvard pursuing a **B.A. and M.S. in Computer Science**, minor in English. My research interests include: machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, algorithmic fairness & privacy, and creating tools to make education more accessible.

As part of MIT CSAIL's [Internet Policy Research Initiative](https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/) group, I'm doing research on designing & building a conversational, natural language programming agent used to make CS education more accessible. Last summer, I was a SWE intern at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) developing automation infrastructure for Xcode. 

I love hackathons and have organized 10+ hackathons (international, national, institutional, and regional). In 2016, I [founded](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/catherine-yeo-pixelhacks-hackathon-interview) and led [PixelHacks](http://pixelhacks.com/), the Bay Area's first all-female high school hackathon, which is now in its 5th iteration. I also currently direct [HackHarvard](http://hackharvard.io/).

In my free time, I like to write fiction (fantasy, sci-fi, & drama) and have amassed over 200K+ readers across stories published online. I also love calligraphy, rewatching Star Wars movies, and cheering on the Golden State Warriors.
