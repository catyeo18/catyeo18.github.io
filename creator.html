			        When author Catherine Yeo started publishing content online nearly a decade ago, she was stunned when she learned she could build an audience of hundreds of thousands and make money from the venture. While she didn’t realize she was a creator then, Yeo did recognize the impending movement and power content creation had on our future.<br><br>

			        <i>The Creator Revolution: How Today’s Creative Talents Are Shaping Our Tomorrow</i> examines the historic rise of digital content creators and their impact on transforming both our present and our future. You'll hear incredible stories about creators such as... <br>
			        <ul>
					<li> Issa Rae, star and co-creator of HBO’s Insecure, who launched her filmmaking career on YouTube. </li>
					<li> Claudine James, a teacher who went from instructing twenty-two students in her classroom to over 3 million on TikTok. </li>
					<li> Ryan Kaji, who earned $30 million in 2020 as a nine-year-old creator and entrepreneur.</li>
					</ul>

					Today, over 50 million people consider themselves creators and more than 200 million pieces of content are published every minute.
