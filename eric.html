        Today marks 5 months since my boyfriend and I started dating. It's been absolutely surreal to see and experience these 5 months pass by (<code>zoom zoom</code>). To commemorate this incredible milestone, I thought I'd share 5 things I love about my boyfriend, one for every month.
      </p>

      <p>
      	It was too difficult narrowing it down to only 5 items, because there are simply too many things to love about him. Here are some <strong>honorable mentions</strong> that just barely didn't make it into the final five:
      	<ul>
      		<li> His prowess for the nerdiest puns and analogies. It's a skill to be nerdy, it's a much more swoon-worthy skill to use your nerdiness for good. and memes. My heart beats for him in <code>O(n log n)</code> runtime. </li> <br>
      		<li> His <span class="highlighted">Michelangelo-sculpted hands</span>. How I miss holding them within my pudgy sausage hands. His hands are the epitomal definition of perfection. EOM. </li> <br>
      		<li>Pretty much everything about him. I miss him so much.</li>
      	</ul>
      </p>

      <h2>1) How little things bring him so much joy</h2>
      <p>
        Seeing Eric's face light up with joy is the best feeling in the world. Any time I get to witness such a moment, I feel extremely blessed. His lips burst into a magnificent smile, his eyes gleam with pure, unbridled joy, and I just want to kiss him. </p>

        <p>While he is (extremely) competitive, which I also love about him, he's not like many others in how one's happiness rests upon achievements.</p>

        <p>It's the purest streak of unbridled joy that gleams in his eyes. Small things that make him happy
