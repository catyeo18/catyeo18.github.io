      <p>
        Today marks 5 months since my boyfriend and I started dating. It's been absolutely surreal to see and experience these 5 months pass by (<code>zoom zoom</code>). To commemorate this incredible milestone, I thought I'd share 5 things I love about my boyfriend, one for every month.
      </p>

      <p>
      	It was too difficult narrowing it down to only 5 items, because there are simply too many things to love about him. Here are some <strong>honorable mentions</strong> that just barely didn't make it into the final five:
      	<ul>
      		<li> His prowess for the nerdiest puns and analogies. It's a skill to be nerdy, it's a much more swoon-worthy skill to use one's nerdiness for good. aka memes. My heart beats for him in <code>O(n log n)</code> runtime. </li> <br>
      		<li> His <span class="highlighted">Michelangelo-sculpted hands</span>. How I miss holding them within my pudgy sausage hands. His hands are the epitomal definition of perfection. EOM. </li> <br>
      		<li>Pretty much everything about him. I miss him so much.</li>
      	</ul>
      </p>

      <h2>1) How little things bring him so much joy</h2>

      <p>Seeing Eric's face light up with joy is the best feeling in the world. Any time I get to witness such a moment, I feel extremely blessed. </p>

      <p>When he gets super super excited over the different types/styles/colors of mechanical keyboards and laptop stands.</p> 
      <p>When the Chicago Bears finally, <i>finally</i>, win a game.</p>
      <p>When he eagerly shares new videos from his favorite Youtubers.</p> 
      <p>When he fanboys over Apple Pay and the <i>clean</i> Apple Card.</p> 
      <p>When the CS51 textbook mentions memoization.</p> 
      <p>When he beats his blockmates in FIFA.</p>
      <p>When he decides to be spontaneous and buys $2 mango habanero sauce, and delights over it for the rest of the night.</p>
      <p>When he talks about his family and friends, and how proud he is of them.</p>

      <p>His lips always burst into a magnificent smile, his eyes gleam with pure, unbridled joy, and I just want to kiss him.</p>

      <p>While he is (extremely) competitive, which I also love about him, he's not like many others in how one's happiness rests upon achievements. Instead, <span class="highlighted">he values life for what it brings, basking in its simple pleasures</span>.</p>

      <h2>2) How much he loves to learn </h2>

      <p>In normal relationships, people use the term "thirst" to describe being thirsty over each other. However, I am not normal (<code>here's to the crazy ones</code>), so I will be using the term "thirst" to <span class="highlighted">swoon over my boyfriend thirsting over knowledge</span>.</p>

      <p>I love that he undertakes any and every avenue (from news to Youtube black holes to Medium) to learn more in being a better PM, better chess player, better finance bro™, a better and more knowledgeable human being overall. </p>

	  <p>A couple weeks ago, I swooned so hard during his extensive explanation of defusing land mines. I love him so much.</p>

      <p>He always apologizes for his passionate spiels; I want to tell him to never apologize. Because I fall deeper in love with him every time he does.</p>

      <h2>3) How he hugs me</h2>

      <p>The night we came back to campus after Harvard-Yale and had a long midnight talk outside New Quincy, he put his arm around me and pulled me in closer. He doesn't know this, but my mind literally blacked out for a few seconds as it reveled in that sensation.</p>

      <p>I still swoon thinking about moments he puts his arm around me.</p>

      <p>Or when he hugs me from the front, and I get to rest my head on his chest, and he rests his chin on my head.</p>

      <p>Or when he hugs me from the back, surprising me by wrapping his arms around my body and leaning his head over my shoulder.</p>

      <p>Or when we're 3000 miles apart, but have our special Zoom hug - fling arms out wide, then cross in front of our chest. My heart always flutters with warmth seeing him do that.</p>

      <p><span class="highlighted">I've never felt more at home than in his arms.</span></p>

      <h2>4) How much he supports me in everything I do</h2>

      <p>A part of me always feared that I'd never find a partner who could accept me for I was, so I would need to hide parts of my true self. It's a perfectly reasonable assumption - no girl likes so many things that are so all-over-the-place.</p>

      <p>And then I met Eric.</p>

      <p>He somehow puts up with the crazed NBA sports fanatic that I am. Sends me consoling gifs when the Warriors lose, celebrate with minion gifs with me when I win that week's fantasy basketball matchup.</p>

      <p>He somehow puts up with the even more crazed fandom engager/writer/artist/whatever-this-is that I am. The only person IRL I've entrusted to read any of my romance fanfics. And he toppled me over with surprise the one day he read it and wrote me extensive comments & support - basically a live transcript of his reading experience. It made me cry from joy and gratitude.</p>

      <p>He encourages my bouts of insanity where I suddenly have a new interest and throw myself into it.</p>

      <p><i>Like the ridiculous vlogs I send him.</i> He watches and reacts to every second of them.<p>

      <p>He even puts up with my super insane ideas of shared hobbies we could do together.</p> 

      <p>Well, more than "put up" - he watched ALL NINE STAR WARS MOVIES <strong><i>AND</i></strong> THE MANDALORIAN.</p>

      <p>He takes goofy selfies with me that I browse and swoon over regularly. He reads books every month with me (16 months and ongoing!). He watches every single YouTube video I send him.</p>

      <p>I love him so much the world cannot handle my love. I cannot thank him enough for accepting me for who I am and supporting me in everything I do.</p>

      <h2>5) How he has the world's biggest heart</h2>

      <p>
        I could gush about my boyfriend's <span class="highlighted">big heart energy</span> for a whole century. Seriously.
      </p>

      <p>Like that time he brought me the softest, chewiest cookie after CS121 lecture even though I didn't ask for one, or even know about it. He just... thought of me. And I still tear up thinking about such a kind gesture.</p>

      <p>Or that time he washed dishes with me when he came to my house. He stunned me in being the first friend who ever came to my house to: 1) clear their dishes, 2) volunteer to wash dishes, AND 3) actually go through with their offer and wash dishes. That was such a fun moment.</p>

      <p>At CBE formal, he continuously asked and checked with me to see that everything was going okay, that I wasn't feeling uncomfortable (<code>un-com-fur-tuh-boh</code>). It was so touching of him to do so.</p>

      <p>And, not to mention, ALL the times he helped me without asking.</p>

      <p>The uncountably many times he helped me put on my coat and adjust my despicable sling - on our way to class, after Tech Ethics, before Datamatch meetings - pretty much <strong>all the time</strong>. He was so gentle and careful and tender, my heart melted.</p>

      <p>When he literally yeeted over to Dunster to find me after I said I went to HUHS for a small checkup. He had lunch with me, hugged me, and comforted me in the best possible way: his warm presence.</p>

      <p>When he, again, literally yeeted over to Dunster to check on me after I sent a perfectly harmless photo with a bag of ice. I got to sit in his lap as he enveloped me in a warm, fluffy-pink-hoodie hug, holding up the ice to my face.</p>

      <p>(Huh I am seeing a pattern.)</p>

      <p>(A pattern of how great my boyfriend is!!)</p>
      
      <p>I deeply love and admire how much he cares for his family and friends, how he hates it more than anything when his friends get hurt.</p> 

      <p>I'm so lucky to have him, and so lucky that he entrusts me with his heart. <span class="highlighted">I promise to always take good care of it.</span></p>

	  <!-- Conclusion -->
	  <center><p>. . .</p></center>

	  <p>I've always wanted to write a Medium article, but too scared to truly post my writing online, so in a way you've made another one of my dreams come true.  </p>

	  <p>This extensive whitespace style is genuinely addicting. I can see why so many Medium bloggers think what they say is important, when they do a line break every other sentence. (I definitely went overboard with formatting as well. Oh well.)</p>

	  <p>Instead of happy readings, let me wish you a happy 5-monthsversary, Eric. I love you so much.</p>
